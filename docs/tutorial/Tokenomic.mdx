## What Is ANI

![logo](/img/logo.png)

`ANI` is AnimeSwap native token. It represents the owner's rights, interests and benefits in the [AnimeSwap protocol](http://animeswap.org/).

Currently, AnimeSwap is only deployed on [Aptos](https://aptoslabs.com/), and `ANI` is only circulates on Aptos mainnet.
If AnimeSwap and `ANI` deployed on other chains in the future, this documents will be updated.

### Emission

The main distribution of emission is [#staking-and-farm](#staking-and-farm)

DeFi is fast evolving, and AnimeSwap will keep evolving.
If there are better direction for ecosystem growth, AnimeSwap will adjust emission distribution and rate via [vote-and-governance](#vote-and-governance).

### Airdrop of Liquidity Providers

* [Snapshot Open Source Code](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop)
* [Airdrop Liquidity Providers addresses (total 1001)](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt)

Airdrop of liquidity providers is a snapshot of the contribution by the AnimeSwap community members on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot calculation is based on the liquidity provider and their **total value locked** (TVL) on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot time range
* Start: Aptos Mainnet `version 2484089`, `2022-10-19 03:28:16 UTC`, as soon as AnimeSwap protocol launch on Aptos Mainnet
* End: Aptos Mainnet `version 14400000`, `2022-10-27 06:02:10 UTC`

Each address contribution is calculated by the following formula:

$$
Address Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}AddressTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
Total Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}ProtocolTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
TotalANI = 9,216,500
$$

$$
Address ANI = \frac{Address Contribution}{Total Contribution}\cdot TotalANI
$$

The validated pair of snapshot is Top 12 TVL pairs at snapshot end time:

```
APT/tAPT
APT/zUSDC
APT/whWBTC
APT/zWETH
APT/whWETH
APT/whUSDC
APT/stAPT
APT/zUSDT
zUSDC/zUSDT
USDA/zUSDT
APT/MOJO
whUSDC/zUSDC
```

For non APT pair, `10 USD` equals to `1 APT` weight.

There are more than 5000 addresses in upper formula result, most of them are too small contributions (bots or less than `$0.1` TVL). The snapshot takes `3.5 APT*day` as threshold for minimum contribution.

Finally, the snapshot get [1001 individual addresses](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt) for ANI liquidity providers airdrop.

### Airdrop of Community Early Backers

* [Airdrop OG addresses (total 936)](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/OG_bind_address.txt)

AnimeSwap community early backers (Discord OG roles) totally receive `783,500 ANI` airdrop, early backers are from many different events before Aptos mainnet,
such as Twitter spread, Discord server boost, and anime picture shares.

All the early backers have to [bind wallet address with Discord authorization](https://twitter.com/animeswap_org/status/1585635543915778048) on DApp before airdrop.

* `500 ANI` per OG role
* `1000 ANI` per OG2 role

## Usages

### Staking and Farm

`ANI` could be used into staking and farm to earn more `ANI` and other tokens.

Staking and farm are also the main part of emission `ANI`.

More about staking and farm (MasterChef module) see other documents (write in progress).

### Vote and Governance

`ANI` could be used to vote and governance.

AnimeSwap community members could vote and governance on AnimeSwap protocol and ecosystem with `ANI` token.

Anyone with more than `0.1% of ANI supply` can issue a new proposal, such as:
* Change pair swap fee for better growth
* How to distribute emission `ANI` for [farm](#staking-and-farm)
* How to allocate [DAO treasury](#dao-treasury)
* Developing new features
* Deploy on other chains
* ...

AnimeSwap Labs responsible for implementation proposals

Proposals and voting system is in progress.

### DAO Treasury

AnimeSwap contract address has a DAO Treasury.

There are many ways of DAO Treasury income: part of swap fee, ecosystem cooperation, and AnimeSwap will develop more ways.

The ways of allocating DAO treasury are [voted by community members](#vote-and-governance).

The purpose of the DAO Treasury is to help projects grow better, if there are no better allocating usages, the DAO Treasury will buybuck `ANI` and burn.

### Whitelist Eligibility

AnimeSwap Labs will public some free NFT with Anime style or Anime IP cooperation. The whitelist eligibility of mint is based on `ANI` token, including `ANI` in staking and farm.

### Buy Anime Goods

AnimeSwap Labs love Anime culture, `ANI` will **be used as currency** to buy reality Anime culture goods in the future.
