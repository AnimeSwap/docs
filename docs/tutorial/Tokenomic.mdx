### Airdrop of Liquidity Providers

* [Snapshot Open Source Code](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop)
* [Airdrop Liquidity Providers addresses](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt)

Airdrop of liquidity providers is a snapshot of the contribution by the AnimeSwap community members on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot calculation is based on the liquidity provider and their **total value locked** (TVL) on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot time range
* Start: Aptos Mainnet `version 2484089`, `2022-10-19 03:28:16 UTC`, as soon as AnimeSwap protocol launch on Aptos Mainnet
* End: Aptos Mainnet `version 14400000`, `2022-10-27 06:02:10 UTC`

Each address contribution is calculated by the following formula:

$$
Address Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}AddressTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
Total Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}ProtocolTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
Address ANI = \frac{Address Contribution}{Total Contribution}\cdot TotalANI
$$

The validated pair of snapshot is Top 12 TVL pairs at snapshot end time:

```
APT/tAPT
APT/zUSDC
APT/whWBTC
APT/zWETH
APT/whWETH
APT/whUSDC
APT/stAPT
APT/zUSDT
zUSDC/zUSDT
USDA/zUSDT
APT/MOJO
whUSDC/zUSDC
```

For non APT pair, `10 USD` equals to `1 APT` weight.

There are more than 5000 addresses in upper formula result, most of them are too small contributions (bots or less than `$0.1` TVL). The snapshot takes `3.5 APT*day` as threshold for minimum contribution.

Finally, the snapshot get [1001 individual addresses]((https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt)) for ANI liquidity providers airdrop.
