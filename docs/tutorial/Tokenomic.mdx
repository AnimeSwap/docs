## What Is ANI

`ANI` is AnimeSwap native token. It represents the owner's rights, interests and benefits in the [AnimeSwap protocol](http://animeswap.org/).

Currently, AnimeSwap is only deployed on [Aptos](https://aptoslabs.com/), and `ANI` is only circulates on Aptos mainnet.
If AnimeSwap and `ANI` deployed on other chains in the future, this documents will be updated.

## Distribution and Emission

| Distribution         | Initial ANI            | Emission (ANI)           | Description   |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|--|
| Liquidity Providers Airdrop | 9,000,000 | - | No claim for 7 days will be burned |
| Early Backers Airdrop | 1,000,000 | - | No claim for 7 days will be burned |
| AnimeSwap Labs | 0 | unlock 500,000 per 90 days [*1] | 4 years for total unlock [*2] |
| Emission | 0 | ~0.317 per second | 10,000,000 ANI per year |
| Burn | 0 | reduce emission | [*3] |

[*1] AnimeSwap Labs locked token can't join staking or farming

[*2] Totally 16 rounds of unlock

[*3] There are [#Usages](#usages) and applications to burn `ANI` to reduce emission

### Emission

The main distribution of emission is [#staking-and-farm](#staking-and-farm)

DeFi is fast evolving, and AnimeSwap will keep evolving.
If there are better direction for ecosystem growth, AnimeSwap will adjust emission distribution and rate via [vote-and-governance](#vote-and-governance).

### Airdrop of Liquidity Providers

* [Snapshot Open Source Code](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop)
* [Airdrop Liquidity Providers addresses](https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt)

Airdrop of liquidity providers is a snapshot of the contribution by the AnimeSwap community members on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot calculation is based on the liquidity provider and their **total value locked** (TVL) on Aptos mainnet.

The snapshot time range
* Start: Aptos Mainnet `version 2484089`, `2022-10-19 03:28:16 UTC`, as soon as AnimeSwap protocol launch on Aptos Mainnet
* End: Aptos Mainnet `version 14400000`, `2022-10-27 06:02:10 UTC`

Each address contribution is calculated by the following formula:

$$
Address Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}AddressTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
Total Contribution = \sum_{t=2484089}^{14400000}ProtocolTVL\cdot\Delta(t)
$$

$$
Address ANI = \frac{Address Contribution}{Total Contribution}\cdot TotalANI
$$

The validated pair of snapshot is Top 12 TVL pairs at snapshot end time:

```
APT/tAPT
APT/zUSDC
APT/whWBTC
APT/zWETH
APT/whWETH
APT/whUSDC
APT/stAPT
APT/zUSDT
zUSDC/zUSDT
USDA/zUSDT
APT/MOJO
whUSDC/zUSDC
```

For non APT pair, `10 USD` equals to `1 APT` weight.

There are more than 5000 addresses in upper formula result, most of them are too small contributions (bots or less than `$0.1` TVL). The snapshot takes `3.5 APT*day` as threshold for minimum contribution.

Finally, the snapshot get [1001 individual addresses]((https://github.com/AnimeSwap/airdrop/blob/main/LP_snapshot_address.txt)) for ANI liquidity providers airdrop.
