**AnimeSwap V1** is a protocol of decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) runs on Move Virtual Machine. Anyone could interact with the protocol for swaping coins and earn coins.

AnimeSwap protocol has three basic usages:

* Swap: create a completely free trading experience for everyone.
* Earn: earn with automated market maker in a easiest way, more profit, less loss.
* Build: as a public protocol that every DApp, every tools  and every one could connect, as a infrastructure to improve on-chain liquidity.

The vision of AnimeSwap is to be optimistic and fanciful, and build decentralized infrastructure for the world. Keep mindset like watching anime.

AnimeSwap Labs members like anime, comic and games. We want to spread and share fanciful cultures with Crypto World. Swap is concise and is the basis symbol of decentralized protocol. Combining the two, we have AnimeSwap.
